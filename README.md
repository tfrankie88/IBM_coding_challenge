## Morgan & Morgan Coding Assessment

This is a static single page to present a simple autocomplete search widget.

### directions
1. Unzip file
2. run `npm install --save` for dependencies
3. run `gulp` to compress the scss, js, and html files from src folder into a dist folder to minify files and convert scss in css

### notes
1. Very simple widget using vanilla javascript, with hardcoded array items for autocomplete example.
2. style: the list of autocompleted items has a slight padding to add a nice ux bottom border prior to search.
